# Distinctiveness Centrality in Social Networks - Python Library
A Python library to calculate Distinctiveness Centrality in social networks. 


Distinctiveness Centrality is a new set of network metrics which attribute a larger importance to connections with network periphery. 
This is different from the goal of some established metrics, which identify central nodes based on their brokerage power, the number and weight of their connections, and the ability to quickly reach all other nodes.

Formulas and full descriptions are provided in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03391).

## Installation
```python
pip install distinctivness-centrality
```

## Quick Start and Tutorials
- A quick-start demo is available in [this notebook](DistinctivenessCentralityDemo.ipynb).

More materials will follow in the near future.
