# Distinctiveness Centrality - Python Library
A Python library to calculate Distinctiveness Centrality in social networks. The current implementation is based on [Networkx](https://github.com/networkx/networkx){:target="_blank"}.


In contrast to established metrics, which identify central nodes based on their brokerage
power, the number and weight of their connections, and the ability to quickly reach all
other nodes, we introduce five new measures of Distinctiveness Centrality. Those new
metrics
